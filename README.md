## Installation & Running Locally  

- Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/factory-management.git
Install and run the Backend:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
npm start
Install and run the Frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
Define allowed actions per user for a specific day:

Each user has a several number of actions they can perform per day.

To login with a specific user add a record for this user and current day in server/data/usersActionsData.json file.

The record that should be added looks as follows:

json
Copy code
{
  "id": <user_id>,
  "maxActions": 5,
  "date": "<dd/mm/yyyy>",
  "actionAllowd": <numOfActionsUsedTodayForThisUser>
}
<user_id> is the user_id according to: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

<dd/mm/yyyy> is the current date

<actionAllowd> is the number of actions used so far today for this user, the value in this field must be lower than maxActions.

For Example you can add:

json
Copy code
{
  "id": 2,
  "maxActions": 500,
  "date": "18/09/2025",
  "actionAllowd": 0
}
